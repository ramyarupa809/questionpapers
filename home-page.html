So much standard specification is there with this specific software.
<br>
<h3>4. High Stability:<br></h3>
If you want an absolute course outcome this is the best example so far. Some specific regulations would be followed by this format. The basic structure is general and all types of subjects would be covered by this. It has very high stability for all types of learning outcomes. It will furnish with a great generic structure. It can be redesigned also as per the assessment needs. In a rule-based system, this system is very much relevant to use.
<br>
<h3>5. Simple operation:<br></h3>
While we are making any question paper so many things come to our mind. So it has a great chance to repeat the question. But this thing can’t happen with this software. It has a very simple operation with a great interface that no question can be repeated more than one time. So we can avoid this challenge by using this software. It will keep track of all the questions and don’t allow repetition of questions.
<br>
<h3>6. Proper analysis of database:<br></h3>
It is a very important step in planning the assessment of every student. As it covers all the vital components and we can test the knowledge for all students.

<br>
<h3>7. Easy flexibility:<br></h3>
It is very important to know the question paper pattern and Marks allocation Scheme. So while designing the question paper the challenge is that the system should give flexibility in choosing the desired paper pattern and allocating marks to each question in the paper.
<br>
<h3>8. Easy formatting of paper:<br></h3>
The generated questions from the system are to be presented in the proper format or proper exam template. So the challenge faced is how to format the layout of the paper in the required style and in a compatible format.
<br>
<h3>9. Chapter-wise allocation:<br></h3>
As there are different types of exams like unit test and end semester exam, so each exam has different modules of chapters covered on which the question paper has to be generated. So challenge faced here is to make a system such that it is able to allocate the question chapter wise or module wise for the respective exams.
<br>
<h3>10. Simple Implementation:<br></h3>
The Automatic Question Paper Generator System is developed and built up using Java programming language. The fully functional system has reserves of courses, questions, and patterns of question papers.
